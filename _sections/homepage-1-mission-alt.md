*The Three Lakes Watershed Association* is a volunteer organization focused on protecting and improving the quality of life in the area of Lake Granby Reservoir, Shadow Mountain Reservoir, and Grand Lake. Activities in recent years have been predominately centered on improving the clarity of the water in both Shadow Mountain Reservoir and Grand Lake. Specifically, we maintain contact with Grand County, US Department of Interior, US Bureau of Reclamation, Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, Colorado River District, and our Colorado Congressional Delegation.  We rely on our members’ time and expertise to make our voice heard on some of the most pressing issues in our community. We invite you to review our website and click on “Get Involved” to join us in our mission to preserve the quality in the three lakes area.
