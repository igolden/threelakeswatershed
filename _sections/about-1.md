**Three Lakes Watershed Association** is a 501(c) 3 non-profits organization that has been in existence for over forty years under several earlier names. Association activities are focused on efforts to protect and improve the quality of life in the area of Granby Reservoir, Shadow Mountain Reservoir, and Grand Lake. The Association has just over 475 members.

Activities in recent years have been predominately focused on improving the quality of the water in both Shadow Mountain Reservoir and Grand Lake. For the past ten years, that has occupied most of our time and resources. Other activities in those ten years have included supporting the effort to retain the Grand Lake Elementary School; keeping members informed about beetle kill problems and solutions; about fire suppression activities of our local Fire Department; activities of our County; goals and activities of the Town; and other local issues. In earlier years, the Association actively opposed legalization of gambling in Grand Lake; and was instrumental in the creation of the Three Lakes Water and Sanitation District that has provided a much needed sewer system for our area. The Association contributed funds for the purchase of the Fire Boat by the local Fire Department.

All of our efforts are done by members and Directors. Occasionally, we retain a law firm or public relations firm.

All of our efforts are funded by dues -- $25/year â€“ and by generous donations from members.

Future plans for the Association will continue to center on water quality issues, but we will react to other local issues as they arise. In these efforts, we maintain contact with the Town of Grand Lake, Grand County, U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,  Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, Colorado River District, Northwest Colorado Counsel of Governments, Grand County Water Information Network, and over 475 Three Lakes Watershed Association Members.

We have annual agreements with Grand County to help fund the algae toxin monitoring effort , with the Grand Lake Fire Department to support operations and maintenance on the Fire Boat, and with Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District  to fund the dock space for their water quality monitoring boat.
