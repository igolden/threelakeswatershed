Our activities in recent years have been predominately centered on improving the clarity of the water in both Shadow Mountain Reservoir and Grand Lake. Specifically, we maintain contact with the Town of Grand Lake, Grand County, U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,  Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, Colorado River District, Northwest Colorado Counsel of Governments, Grand County Water Information Network, and over 475 Three Lakes Watershed Association Members.  We rely on our members’ time and expertise to make our voice heard on some of the most pressing issues in our community. We invite you to review our website and click on “Get Involved” to join us in our mission to preserve the quality in the three lakes area.
