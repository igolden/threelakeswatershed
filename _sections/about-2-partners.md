**COLORADO TROUT UNLIMITED** is a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization that works to protect, conserve and restore Colorado’s coldwater fisheries and their watersheds. As the grassroots arm of their parent organization, Trout Unlimited, they use cooperation, collaboration, advocacy and education to promote conservation.

Founded in 1969, Colorado Trout Unlimited is the state’s leading non-profit, non-partisan organization providing a voice for Colorado’s rivers. As the financially self-sustaining, grassroots, Colorado-based arm of the national organization Trout Unlimited, Colorado TU is independently governed by a 37-member volunteer board.

Colorado Trout Unlimited leverages the power of its 11,000 members from 24 chapters across Colorado who contribute approximately 44,000 volunteer hours annually to restoration, education and other local conservation projects, equivalent to the power of 22 full-time employees.

Their vision is simple – by the next generation, Colorado Trout Unlimited will ensure that robust populations of native and wild coldwater fish once again thrive within their original Colorado range so that our children can enjoy healthy fisheries in their home waters.

Colorado Trout Unlimited works to:

- Protect high quality habitat for native and wild coldwater fish and to    maintain free flowing rivers;
- Reconnect fragmented fish populations and habitats by restoring flows to dewatered rivers and re-opening fish passage;
- Restore watersheds by working in collaboration with other conservation and governmental organizations, as well as private landowners, to preserve and improve the quality of habitats that support coldwater fish;
- Sustain the efforts of our volunteers and supporters by inspiring a strong conservation ethic in the next generation of river stewards.

Education and outreach to Colorado’s young people, providing hands-on, field-based opportunities that foster awareness for the connections between Colorado’s trout, water resources, the environment and themselves.
