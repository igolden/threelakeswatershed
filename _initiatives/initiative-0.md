title: "Restore the Headwaters Initiative"
description: "Several years ago, we merged into your Association the Greater Grand Lake Shoreline Association which gave us 501 C(3) status, as well as resolving competing interests. At a board meeting in April, we agreed to merge into our Association the Restore The Headwaters organization, an entity that has been active in sending complementary messages through social media. The board has also agreed to fund development of a new website that will allow for more efficient dues collections and information distribution."
